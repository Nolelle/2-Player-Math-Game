to contain (encapsulate) logic as part of this app.

Task 2
Write out a brief paragraph describing the role that class will play in your app.

Remember that objects are important for two things:

State: Storing data describing themselves (variables)
Behavior: Defining actions that can be performed on them (methods)

Write down the methods for each class while also speaking to the following points:

What information is relevant to each class?
What will they need in order to be initialized?
What public methods will be defined on them?

Furthermore:

Which class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)?
Which class should manage who the current_player is?
Which class(es) will contain user I/O and which will not have any?
